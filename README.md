# hello-world

Justin Plaetzler is your average nerd that gets giddy from making an application bend to his will with just a few lines of code. He likes to create order and structure in his world both IRL and virtually. Justin has experience with several different languages and platforms, but if there's something he doesn't know just give it a little bit and he'll figure it out.
Justin currently finds himself patching legacy systems to meet the needs of his currently employer. Soon though he will move on and start building applications on a full time basis and work at preventing the need for patches and updates on his systems by thoroughly understanding the present and future needs of his clients.
